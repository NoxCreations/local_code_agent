# local_code_agent
This script (`local_code_agent.py`) creates a standalone AI developer that runs entirely on your local machine. It connects to local LLM servers (like LM Studio or Ollama) or any openai-compatible api endpoint, and acts as a bridge, giving the AI "hands" to edit files, run terminal commands, and manage projects safely.
